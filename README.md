# Public Bash Scripts
I'm going to migrate my bash scripts here so that I know where I put them
You can use them too

# makeApacheRedirects
BASH script to set up HTTPS VirtualHosts with Certbot in Apache

I created this bash script to make my life easier when adding websites to my server.
This was written and tested only on Ubuntu 20.04 server

You need to have Apache 2.4+ and Certbot installed.
Apache is most likely installed using `sudo apt-get install apache2` or with `sudo apt-get install lamp-server^`

Here is a link to certbot: https://certbot.eff.org/instructions?ws=apache&os=ubuntufocal
